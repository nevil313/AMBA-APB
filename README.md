# AMBA APB Protocol Implementation in Verilog

This repository contains a Verilog-based implementation and simulation of the AMBA APB (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture - Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol. The APB protocol is commonly used in SoC (System on Chip) designs for connecting low-speed peripherals to the system bus.
